    "Some of these numbers may be repeated, and this is the clue.\n",
    "We don't want any repetitions. We want them to be removed.\n",

    "Your task is to write a program which removes all the number repetitions from the list.\n",
    "The goal is to have a list in which all the numbers appear not more than once.\n",

    "Note: assume that the source list is hard-coded inside the code - you don't have to enter it from the keyboard.\n",
    "Of course, you can improve the code and add a part that can carry out a conversation with the user and obtain all the data from her/him.\n",
