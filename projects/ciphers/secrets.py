Ciphers transform messages into an unrecognizable form to secure information
from unauthorized access. Typically, they rearrange, substitute, or manipulate
the characters in the original message based on a key. Modern ciphers, such as
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), rely on complex mathematical algorithms
that make them infeasible even for computers to break through brute force.
With current computing systems, it would take millions of years to test every
possible key! As a result, AES is widely used to secure digital communications,
from text messages to bank transfers. However, AES is still only as strong as
the secrecy of its key, so make sure to keep your key private!
